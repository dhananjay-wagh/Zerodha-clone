This project is a static recreation of the Zerodha landing page, developed to practice modern front-end web development techniques using pure HTML and CSS.

Key features include:

Responsive Design: Uses flexbox to create a fluid layout that adapts to different screen sizes.

Sticky Navigation: The navigation bar remains fixed at the top for easy access while scrolling.

Custom Fonts & Styling: Integrates Google Fonts (Roboto, Inter) for professional typography and follows Zerodha's branding guidelines.

Semantic HTML: Structured with semantic tags for better accessibility and SEO.

The project demonstrates a strong understanding of CSS fundamentals, including layout, typography, and responsive design principles.
